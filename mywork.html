                <h4>Last Table App Project</h4>
                <p>The project aimed to develop a user-centric app tailored for individuals seeking last-minute dining
                    options,
                    facilitating the discovery of popular local restaurants and the seamless booking of reservations on
                    short notice.
                    Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods, including user interviews,
                    online surveys,
                    and competitor analysis, we delved into user behaviors and preferences surrounding restaurant
                    selection and
                    reservation processes. Insights revealed a strong preference for convenience, varied reservation
                    practices,
                    and reliance on digital tools for restaurant discovery.</p>
                <p>Design implications emphasized the need for a seamless
                    reservation process, real-time availability updates, and integration of social proof elements.
                    Ultimately, the
                    project sought to enhance the dining experience by providing users with a user-friendly platform
                    that caters to both
                    spontaneous and planned dining outings, delivering accurate information and facilitating informed
                    decision-making.</p>

                <h4>Caring Hands Website Redesign</h4>
                <p>Our UX research project focused on addressing usability barriers encountered by cat lovers interested
                    in fostering,
                    adopting, or supporting Loving Care Cat Rescue (LCCR). The organization's website presented
                    frustrating obstacles,
                    hindering user engagement with adoption processes and donation efforts. Our primary objective was to
                    streamline the
                    adoption process, effectively communicate LCCR's mission, showcase cats in need of homes, generate
                    community interest,
                    and nurture a passion for animal welfare to drive increased adoptions. By conducting a thorough
                    audit of the current
                    home page, we scrutinized navigation, content, and structure to identify usability errors
                    obstructing LCCR's
                    communication objectives. Users faced challenges navigating through complicated menus, dense text
                    blocks, and a
                    lack of focus on the organization's mission.</p>

                <p> To address these issues, we employed ideation and strategic feature prioritization to outline key
                    improvements.
                    Our redesign approach aimed to revamp navigation, refocus content to convey LCCR's mission more
                    effectively,
                    and introduce interactive, transparent donation guidance. These key features emerged from our
                    analysis as critical
                    components for enhancing user experience and facilitating greater engagement with LCCR's adoption
                    and support initiatives.
                    By prioritizing these features, we aimed to create a more intuitive, user-friendly website that
                    empowers users to easily
                    explore adoption opportunities, contribute to the organization's mission, and foster a stronger
                    connection with animals
                    in need.</p>
